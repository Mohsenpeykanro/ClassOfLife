# ClassOfLife

A C++ simulation of biological systems, modeling the structure and behavior of nucleotides, genomes, cells, and viruses.

## üß¨ Project Overview

ClassOfLife is an object-oriented C++ project designed to simulate fundamental biological entities and their interactions. It serves as an educational tool to understand the complexities of life at the molecular and cellular levels.

## üî¨ Features

- **Nucleotide Modeling**: Representation of RNA and DNA nucleotides.
- **Genome Construction**: Assembly of genomes with mutation and replication capabilities.
- **Cell Simulation**: Modeling of cells with behavior like division and interaction with genetic material.
- **Virus Behavior**: Simulation of virus infection processes in host cells.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Build System**: CMake
- **IDE Support**: JetBrains CLion (`.idea/` included, but optional)

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.cpp`: Entry point for the simulation.
- `Animal.cpp` / `Animal.h`: Classes representing animals and their functions.
- `cell.cpp` / `cell.h`: Cell class definition and implementation.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration for the project.
- `.idea/`: Project configuration for CLion (can be ignored if not using CLion).
